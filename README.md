This console-based banking application project designed to simulate and simplified banking system. 
It provides a command-line interface that allows users to perform various banking operations
such as, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers. 
The main goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and secure banking application 
that can be operated through a command-line interface, making it accessible to users without a graphical user interface. 
The application will offer a range of functionalities commonly found in traditional banking systems, 
enabling users to manage their accounts efficiently.
